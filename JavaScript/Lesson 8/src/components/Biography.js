    <h2>Van Gogh</h2>
    </div>
  <p>Vincent van Gogh, in full Vincent Willem 
    van Gogh, (born March 30, 1853, Zundert,
     Netherlands—died July 29, 1890,
      Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, France),
       Dutch painter, generally considered 
       the greatest after Rembrandt van Rijn,
        and one of the greatest of the 
        Post-Impressionists. The striking colour,
         emphatic brushwork, and contoured forms
          of his work powerfully influenced the
           current of Expressionism in modern art.
            Van Gogh’s art became astoundingly
             popular after his death, especially
              in the late 20th century, when his
               work sold for record-breaking sums
                at auctions around the world and 
                was featured in blockbuster touring
                 exhibitions. In part because of his
                 ensive published letters, van Gogh has
                  also been mythologized in the popular
                   imagination as the quintessential tortured artist.</p>
