    <h1>WHAT IS LOREM IPSUM?</h1>
    <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum </strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has<br>
         been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer<br> 
         took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not<br>
          only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially<br>
           unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing<br> 
           Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus<br>
            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
            <h2>WHY DO WE USE IT?</h2>
            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a<br>
                 page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less<br>
                  normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it<br>
                   look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use<br>
                    Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many<br> 
                    web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by<br> 
                    accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
                    <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of<br>
                         classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a<br>
                          Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure<br>
                           Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the<br> 
                           word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from<br> 
                           sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and<br> 
                           Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very<br>
                            popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit<br>
                             amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
